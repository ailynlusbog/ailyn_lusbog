<p><h2 style="color:darkgreen"> HISTORY OF COUSIN's CUISINE </h2> </p>
<br><h2 style="color:maroon"> Filipino cuisine has developed from the different cultures that shaped its history; it is like other Southeast Asian cuisines but with heavy Spanish influence. Some ingredients of the Mexican cuisine, such as corn, tomato and chili, have also found their way to the Philippines.

Though its cuisine is not as renowned as many of its neighbours, such as that of Thailand and Vietnam, Filipino cooking is nonetheless distinct in that it is possibly the least spicy of all South East Asian cuisines.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that Filipino food is bland, though. It is just that instead of spices, Filipino food depends more on garlic, onions and ginger to add flavor to dishes. Painstaking preparation and prolonged cooking time is also a characteristic of most Filipino dishes, and when done properly is often what brings out the flavor of the food, as opposed to a healthy dose of spices. With over 7,500 islands, the cuisine of the Philippines is rather a mish-mash of hundreds of local, regional, and ethnic cuisines, and without any qualifiers, you would often think of ubiquitous dishes such as adobo, sinigang, lechon, and Filipino-Chinese dishes. </h1> </br>
<br><h2 style="color:maroon"> The word diet is non-existent in the vocabulary of Filipinos or has never existed, as mentioned before they are laid-back people, they love to eat as much as they can as if there is no tomorrow. They spend most of their money on food, and a Filipino teenager might at least enter a fast food chain two or three times a week, during fiestas in a city, town, barangay, purok or subdivision Filipinos would have big parties and it would last from noon to midnight when some of the people would end up being drunk, you can ask if you can join a fiesta in a home and some might welcome you as this is a tradition.

While you're visiting the Philippines is the best time to cheat on your diet and eat to your heart's content. The Filipino diet is sometimes a lot more similar to the West than the rest of the East, with Filipinos eating fewer fruits and vegetables, more oil, meat and sugar than people in neighboring nations; many Filipinos aren't health-conscious. Cancer and heart-related diseases are the leading causes of death here. However if you visit rural areas, they use more fresh produce (vegetables, fruits, grains, etc.) and less meat and practice old Filipino medicine. In coastal areas, fish and many sorts of seafood are usually served and eaten. </h1> </br>

<br><h2 style="color:maroon"> Meal times
Meal times are much influenced by Hispanic traditions. An average Filipino eats four meals a day, but at earlier times; thus, the typical meal schedule is closer to that in the United States. Breakfast (almusal/agahan/pamahaw) is traditionally eaten between 7 to 11AM (or earlier). A typical Filipino breakfast meal can be as light as coffee and salted bread buns (pandesal), or full as any of the silog breakfasts — composed of fried rice (sinangag), egg — scrambled or fried ("sunny side up"), and a main — commonly tapa (smoked beef), tocino (cured pork), or longganisa (pork sausage). Other common breakfast items are lugaw (congee) and champorado (chocolate rice porridge). Fast food restaurants provide both Filipino and Western breakfast options.
Lunch runs between 11AM through 3PM, and traditionally involves a siesta, though it's no longer as common in the past. Children are often asked to nap after having lunch, especially in conservative Filipino families.
There is also a traditional afternoon snack (merienda) which runs at the late afternoon, usually 3PM through 6PM.
Dinner starts at 6PM and can be light as bread and coffee, or heavy with a multi-course meal. </h1> </br>
